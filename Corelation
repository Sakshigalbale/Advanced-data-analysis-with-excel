Correlation
------------
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.

-> Positive Correlation (+1): As one variable increases, the other also increases.
  Example: Height and weight.
-> Negative Correlation (–1): As one variable increases, the other decreases.
  Example: Number of hours studied and number of mistakes in an exam.
-> No Correlation (0): No linear relationship exists between the variables.
  Example: Shoe size and intelligence.

Correlation Coefficient (r value) -> ranges between –1 and +1.

R-Squared Value
---------------
R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that shows how well the independent variable(s) explain the variation in the dependent variable.

R² ranges from 0 to 1:

R² Value	Interpretation
0	The model explains none of the variability.
0.5	The model explains 50% of the variability.
1	The model explains all of the variability.

 R² vs Correlation (r):
Correlation (r) measures strength and direction of a linear relationship.
R² = r², when dealing with one independent and one dependent variable.

For example:
If r = 0.9, then R² = 0.81 → 81% of variation is explained.
